    "# Last homework: designing a microscope using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final homework assignment, we will design a microscope using machine learning! In order to do this, we will combine elements of HW3 (CNNs) and HW4 (microscope simulator) into a single end-to-end architecture. In particular, we will convert the MNIST digits into phase/amplitude objects and process them through a microscope simulator as we did in HW4, add noise, and then feed the output into a CNN to classify the digit. In addition to optimizing the CNN parameters, we will also be simultaneously optimizing the input illumination incident on the sample as well as the aperture plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will walk you through the steps of implementing this joint architecture, leaving some portions blank for you to implement. We will first instruct you to use specific values that we have tested and are known to give reasonable results. Later on, you will revisit the code and explore different hyperparameter settings."
